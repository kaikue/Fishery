# Fishery
A Minecraft mod about generating resources by breeding fish

## TODO
- Creative tab icon
- JEI integration
- Fix version number in build?

## Brainstorming
- Maintain nutrient levels in hatchery in order to get breeding to happen quickly
	- sugar
	- wheat
	- netherwart
	- fresh water?
- find fish in pools in world
- breeding:
	- require one of each parent + material of potential child
	- gives 2 children: each is random between parent types and crossbreed
	- chance different per crossbreed type?
- spawning:
	- place 2 parent types in hatchery
	- gives 2-4 child eggs: each is random between parent types
		- better nutrients = more children
		- offspring output in breeding slot = chance for crossbreed children (configurable, required by default)
	- produce child eggs
		- can be grown in incubator into adult fish
			or processed in ~centrifuge~ into materials
- incubating: requires fuel or RF, high light level (glowstone above), converts eggs -> adult fish
- centrifuge: requires fuel or RF, converts eggs -> resources
- hatchery: requires nutrient balance
	- high crossbreed chance- nether wart
	- lots of offspring- wheat
	- fast reproduction cycle- sugar
	- each increases corresponding quantity by 25%, breeding reduces it by 50% each cycle
		- effect is ceiling'ed so 76% = full effect (since you can't insert a new item), but 75% = three-quarters effect
- auto-hatchery multiblock- for lots of fish
	- hatchery monitor (lets you see parents and nutrient levels)
	- fish input valve (no GUI, input parent fish)
	- egg output valve (no GUI, outputs eggs into chest/pipe)
	- nutrient input valve (no GUI, input nutrients)
	- mutation input valve (no GUI, input the desired crossbreed output- only gets used up by applicable breeding pair)
	- hatchery glass (no GUI, just fills out space)
	- 2 parents per block
	- faster than manual hatchery
	- higher nutrient caps?
	- crafting requires a bunch of metal + fish-only resources
	- parent fish are automatically paired based on insertion order
		- could restrict to one type- easy but more space/materials if you want multiple types
		- could pump in randomly- easy but risk losing fish
		- could automate inserting in order- hard but get full benefits
	- render as big tank with all parents swimming around
- water filter?
	- pump in water/dirty water and RF, pump out fresh water/regular water and slime/other product?
	- fresh/regular water gives ??? benefit, dirty water gives ??? punishment?
	
- //auto-hatchery single block?
	- simpler rendering- full block with static textures? (run some benchmarks)
	- requires automated input/output- GUI only shows info
	- normal hatchery wouldn't do automated I/O
	- faster? higher nutrient caps?
	- can take multiple parents of same type? different types?
	- no breeding allowed?
- Fish spawn in pools in world
	- Oakfish spawn in aboveground lakes in forest biomes
	- Stonefish spawn in underground lakes (or water < y=50)
	- Snowfish spawn aboveground in frozen biomes
	- Sandfish spawn aboveground in desert/mesa/savanna biomes
	- Lavafish spawn in lava in nether		
- Right click with fishing net (uses durability) to capture fish in world as item in inventory
- Right click fish in world to place as fish entity (entity name = item name)	
- ex: gold + lapis = diamond
	- have 2 hatcheries producing gold and lapis eggs
	- incubate one of each egg type into gold & lapis fish
	- place in breeding hatchery with good nutrient balance and diamonds
	- crossbreed happens at least twice: great, start breeding diamond fish
	- crossbreed happens once: nice, repeat until you get a second one
	- crossbreed does not happen: darn, repeat until you get some
	- once you have 2 diamond eggs: mature them both in incubator, then start breeding (keep 2 each time for repeat breeding, process rest in centrifuge into diamond)

## Content
- [Iron]fish Eggs (dynamically colored)
- [Iron]fish (dynamically colored)
- Lava drop- furnace fuel (25 items), craft 4 around bucket to get lava bucket
- Fish oil- centrifuging a mid-game fish or any adult fish?
- Fishing net (durability)- crafted from sticks & string
- Incubator (render fish eggs inside)
	- GUI: eggs (wavy bubbly down arrow) fish, fuel slot + RF bar, alert "<!> Not enough light!"
- Hatchery (render fish parents swimming around inside)
	- GUI: two parent slots (wavy bubbly down arrow) four child slots, fuel slot + RF bar, nutrient slot & % indicator bars, mutation slot
	- Hatchery multiblock and individual blocks
- Processor? Centrifuge?- put in fish eggs to extract resources
- Mimicfish- can't be bred on its own (different texture), but can be crafted with any other fish to yield 2x that fish
	- bred from enderfish & magicfish
	- "Infertile" in tooltip

- Config options for each fish:
	- name (lang file)
	- enabled: true
	- colors
		- options:
			- generate from item
			- hardcode 3-4
			- hardcode 2 (base, highlight) and lighten/darken for other colors (or just apply to pair of grayscale textures then combine them)
	- item yield
	- parents (optional, not needed for those that gen in world)
